I used this itially to set up my mongodb connection and set up a basic react and node website
https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-mern-mongodb-express-js-react-js-and-node-js-stack-7e8b20463e66


I got help off a fellow class mate. Adam O'Ceallaigh. 
I was explaining the difficulty I had in connecting to the online mongodb and that I nearly had it set up but wasn't connecting
properly. He assisted me in connecting it properly. As it involved adding some extra lines of code.

He also advised me to use netlify aswell as heroku app for hosting my network. I was able to successfully sey up both of these.
Heroku hosts the server aspect, where as Netlify hosts the front end or the client side. 
These are both linked to my Github account.

He also told me to download an app called cors this permits the data being transferred between netlify and heroku on google chrome
usually this is blocked. This is inside in the libs_required folder aswell as the index.js 

Also for the purpose of github adam recommended tha I used the .gitignore feature. I had seen it used by others but he explained it
so it made more sense to use it then so that it wouldn't upload them modules to github taking so long and also taking up the memory.




I used all of the MongoDb website in order to obtain to connect to the database. I done so using the application method with the 
assistance from pages like this.
