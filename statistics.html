                <li>Cancer mortality across the globe female breast cancer is ranked 5th in terms of mortality</li>
                <li>Decreased shoulder ROM and strength may persist for many years following treatment, and it is estimated that 15%–30% of survivors have 
                    some form of shoulder impairment at 5-year follow-up</li>
                <li>Shoulder and breast-related pain is often a focus of rehabilitation, and may be multifactorial. Shoulder or arm pain can be present in 
                        30%–40% of patients at 5-year follow-up</li>
                <li>There were over 2 million women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 from Breast Cancer.</li>
                <li>Even though the chances of surviving breast cancer have increased over the years it is still the leading cause of cancer related deaths 
                        worldwide with roughly 2.09 million breast cancer related deaths in 2018.</li>
                <li>Upper limb dysfunction (ULD) was reported by up to 62% of women 6 years after treatment.</li>

                <li>Breast cancer is the most common cancer of women in the United States. As of 2018, 1 in 8 women in the U.S. will have had a diagnosis
                    of invasive breast cancer in their lifetime.</li>
                <li>A US-based survey also revealed that 61% of breast cancer survivors were prescribed upper body exercises after their surgery and only 28% 
                    received guidance from a physiotherapist.</li>
                <li>One in nine women will develop breast cancer in the course of their lifetime.</li>
                <li>We have 3,100 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year. 30% of women are diagnosed between the ages of 20-50 years.</li>
